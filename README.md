# Menstruation Station 

## Purpose 

Our hack is an app that enables UNC students to easily locate menstrual products around campus and provide feedback on which stations have which products or need to be restocked. Users can also find out if the products are free or at a cost. The Menstruation Station Flocator aims to take some off the stress fo finding menstrual products on our large and busy campus!
